#### Tips and best practices for pull requests

- If the PR is not ready for review, please mark it as
  [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Submit small, focused PRs addressing a single concern/issue.
- Make sure the PR title reflects the contribution.
- Write a summary that helps understand the change.
- Include usage examples in the summary, where applicable.

### How to get pull requests merged

A PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:

- Major feedback/comments are resolved.
- It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people reasonable time to
  review.
- Approved by at least one code owner.
