# Meetings & Cadence

> Public draft – adapted from legacy Meetings, Planning, Starfish, and Value Stream Mapping

## Summary

Golazo favors a minimal set of tightly focused ceremonies. Each exists to unblock flow, amplify
learning, or adapt priorities—never to recite status already visible on the board.

## Standup (Daily – ~10–15 min)

Order: board right→left, top (Swarm) → bottom (Planned). Discussion is by _ticket_, not by person.

For each in‑progress ticket the Shepherd answers:

1. What is needed to move it to the next column?
2. Any blockers or risks?
3. Critical learning worth sharing?

After tickets: assign reviewers, confirm no one is idle, staff Swarms/Interrupts first, then help
finish work before starting new. Long design debates are explicitly parked.

## Retrospective (Every 1–2 weeks – 60 min)

Goal: celebrate wins + identify waste + choose improvement experiments.

Suggested Agenda:

1. Wins / shout‑outs (energy first)
2. Metrics snapshot (see Measuring Success)
3. Review actions from previous retro
4. New observations (group similar items)
5. Select 1–3 actionable changes (small, testable)
6. Owners + review date

Waste heuristic: If you wouldn’t do more of it if you had time, can you reduce or remove it?

## Dashboard Review (Retro Subsection)

Sample boards/queries: Completed tickets (actual vs estimate), Ticket duration distribution by rail,
Interrupt vs Planned mix, Aging tickets, Swarm frequency. Discuss trends, not just numbers.

## Value Stream Mapping (Ad Hoc)

Run when a ticket dramatically exceeds expectations. Shepherd narrates a neutral, day‑by‑day
timeline. Team treats Shepherd as _innocent_; focus on system factors (dependencies, multitasking,
unclear done). Outcome: concrete prevention ideas (WIP tweak, earlier design validation, missing
monitoring…).

## Planning Session (Often paired with Retro)

- Review unestimated backlog items.
- Clarify acceptance criteria & effort assumptions.
- Assign Effort, Cost of Delay, Business Value (Fibonacci scale) → compute WSJF.
- Reorder backlog (only top items need perfect ordering).
- Pull highest priority items into Ready (Coach gates quality).

Lightweight recording (meeting notes or inline ticket comments) preserves reasoning for future
reference.

## Starfish Retrospective (Quarterly / As Needed)

Broader health check using categories: Start, Stop, Continue, Do More, Do Less. Collect anonymous
inputs (whiteboard / shared doc), cluster themes, discuss high‑count clusters first, extract change
actions.

## Time Investment Guidelines

| Ceremony             | Target Duration | Cadence   | Primary Outcomes                     |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Standup              | 10–15 min       | Daily     | Unblocked flow; staffed urgent work  |
| Retro + Planning     | 60 min          | 1–2 weeks | Improvements chosen; backlog groomed |
| Starfish Retro       | 60–75 min       | Quarterly | Strategic adjustments                |
| Value Stream Mapping | 15–25 min       | Ad hoc    | Waste sources & fixes                |

## Meeting Anti‑Patterns

- Status recital (info already visible on board).
- Design debates in standup instead of small focused follow‑ups.
- Silent standup (lack of questions → missed collaboration).
- Carrying unresolved retro actions from session to session.
- Planning inflation wars (arguing numbers vs clarifying assumptions).
