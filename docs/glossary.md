| Acceptance Criteria                | Observable conditions that prove value has been delivered; written before significant engineering starts and used to verify ticket completion.                                                   | [Tickets & Sizing](tickets.md)       |
| Backlog                            | First column on the board containing candidate items with potential value but not yet committed; anyone can propose items.                                                                       | [Workflow Overview](task-board.md)   |
| Coach                              | Facilitator ensuring process integrity: guides standup and retros, highlights flow issues, champions quality practices—never a task assigner.                                                    | [Roles & Responsibilities](roles.md) |

| WIP (Work In Progress)             | Count of active, in‑flight tickets (not in Backlog/Done). Limiting WIP increases flow and reduces context switching.                                                                             | [WIP & Flow](wip-and-flow.md)        |
