| Term                                    | Definition                                                                                                                                            | Link                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Coach                                   | Facilitator ensuring process integrity: guides standup & retros, highlights flow issues, champions quality practices—never a task assigner.           | `roles.md`                       |
| Column                                  | Vertical board stage representing a distinct state change in learning/validation (e.g., Analyze, Engineer, Release).                                  | `workflow-overview.md`           |
| Cycle Time                              | Elapsed time from ticket Start (leaving Ready) to Done (validated). Excludes time in Backlog.                                                         | `measuring-success.md`           |
| DRI (Designated Responsible Individual) | Short rotation role triaging incidents/interrupts, creating Swarm/Interrupt tickets, and coordinating rapid response.                                 | `roles.md`                       |
| Interrupt                               | Unexpected, non‑Swarm work that still needs tracking (e.g., compliance request). Limited to one active to protect focus.                              | `workflow-overview.md`           |
| Planned                                 | Intentionally prioritized, value‑adding work forming the bulk of throughput.                                                                          | `workflow-overview.md`           |
| Rail                                    | Horizontal swimlane grouping tickets by urgency or type (Swarm, Interrupt, Planned).                                                                  | `workflow-overview.md`           |
| Review Latency                          | Time from PR ready signal to first substantive reviewer feedback.                                                                                     | `measuring-success.md`           |
| Shepherd                                | Person facilitating a ticket’s progress (design doc, reviews, validation) ensuring Definition of Done is met—may pair with others for implementation. | `tickets.md`                     |
| SLA (Service Level Agreement)           | Agreed maximum duration for a ticket (commonly < 2 weeks) after leaving Ready; drives small, testable scope.                                          | `tickets.md`                     |
| Spike                                   | Time‑boxed research ticket answering specific questions; outputs decisions + follow‑on tickets, not production code.                                  | `tickets.md`                     |
| Starfish Retrospective                  | Broader retro format categorizing feedback: Start, Stop, Continue, More, Less to surface strategic adjustments.                                       | `meetings-and-ceremonies.md`     |
| Swarm                                   | Highest priority customer‑impacting issue; team may pause other work to resolve quickly (goal < 1 business day).                                      | `workflow-overview.md`           |
| Ticket                                  | Smallest independently valuable, testable work item with clear acceptance criteria and definition of done.                                            | `tickets.md`                     |
| Value Stream Mapping                    | Structured analysis of an outlier ticket’s timeline to expose waste sources (waiting, multitasking, unclear scope).                                   | `meetings-and-ceremonies.md`     |
| WIP (Work In Progress)                  | Count of active, in‑flight tickets (not in Backlog/Done). Limiting WIP increases flow and reduces context switching.                                  | `wip-and-flow.md`                |
| WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)      | Prioritization heuristic: (Cost of Delay + Business Value) / Effort to maximize value flow.                                                           | `planning-and-prioritization.md` |
