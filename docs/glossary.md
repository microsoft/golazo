| Coach                                   | Facilitator ensuring process integrity: guides standup & retros, highlights flow issues, champions quality practices—never a task assigner.           | [Roles & Responsibilities](roles.md)                        |
| Column                                  | Vertical board stage representing a distinct state change in learning/validation (e.g., Analyze, Engineer, Release).                                  | [Workflow Overview](workflow-overview.md)                   |

| Interrupt                               | Unexpected, non‑Swarm work that still needs tracking (e.g., compliance request). Limited to one active to protect focus.                              | [Workflow Overview](workflow-overview.md)                   |

| Shepherd                                | Person facilitating a ticket’s progress (design doc, reviews, validation) ensuring Definition of Done is met—may pair with others for implementation. | [Tickets & Sizing](tickets.md)                              |
| SLA (Service Level Agreement)           | Agreed maximum duration for a ticket (commonly < 2 weeks) after leaving Ready; drives small, testable scope.                                          | [Tickets & Sizing](tickets.md)                              |

| Swarm                                   | Highest priority customer‑impacting issue; team may pause other work to resolve quickly (goal < 1 business day).                                      | [Workflow Overview](workflow-overview.md)                   |

| WIP (Work In Progress)                  | Count of active, in‑flight tickets (not in Backlog/Done). Limiting WIP increases flow and reduces context switching.                                  | [WIP & Flow](wip-and-flow.md)                               |
