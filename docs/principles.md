# Principles & Mindset

> Public draft – migrated from legacy "Fundamentals" with minor editing for external readers.

## Summary

These principles are the philosophical backbone of Golazo. They bias for flow, shared ownership,
sustainable pace, and fast learning so teams deliver real value early and often.

## Core Principles

### Deliver Quickly

Ship small slices of value instead of waiting for a "big reveal". Faster feedback shortens the risk
window, enables course‑correction, and compounds learning.

### Eliminate Waste

Continuously remove activities that do not add customer or future team value (excess WIP, long
debates without data, manual repetition). Every visible step should earn its keep.

### Defer Commitment

Decide at the last responsible moment—not earlier, not later. Avoid speculative work that might
never be needed while still preparing enough to move fast when the time comes.

### Build Quality In

Quality is created upstream, not inspected in. Tests, observability, design clarity, and peer review
are integrated into the normal flow so rework and defect queues stay near zero.

### Create Knowledge

Treat each change as a chance to grow collective understanding. Lightweight design docs, review
conversations, and ticket ownership rotation spread context and reduce single‑expert risk.

### Respect People

Protect focused time, limit multitasking, and assume good intent. A predictable, humane system
outperforms a heroic one—and sustains long‑term velocity.

### Optimize the Whole

Favor overall throughput of valuable work over local busy‑ness. Sometimes the highest leverage
action is helping someone else finish rather than starting something new.

## Influences

Golazo synthesizes ideas from Lean (flow efficiency, waste reduction), Kanban (visualization, WIP
limits), and Agile (iterative delivery, feedback loops) while emphasizing lightweight documentation
as a knowledge engine. It is intentionally minimal—each practice survives only if it demonstrably
improves flow and learning.

## Applying the Principles

- Deliver Quickly → Keep ticket scope < 2 weeks and release slices that a user or stakeholder can
  validate.
- Eliminate Waste → Visualize blockers and backward ticket movement; discuss root causes in
  retrospectives.
- Defer Commitment → Capture emerging ideas in the backlog without prematurely designing or
  estimating deeply.
- Build Quality In → Require definition of done (tests, monitoring, docs) before starting
  engineering work.
- Create Knowledge → Two design signoffs + two PR reviews ensure context is shared, not siloed.
- Respect People → Enforce individual WIP limits (usually ≤2 active tickets) to reduce cognitive
  load.
- Optimize the Whole → Swarm urgent issues collectively; idle capacity goes first to finishing, not
  starting.
