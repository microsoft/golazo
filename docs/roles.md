# Roles and Responsibilities

## Summary

Golazo keeps formal roles to a minimum. A small set of clearly defined responsibilities sustains
flow, reinforces shared ownership, and creates space for equitable growth.

## Core Roles

### Coach

The process facilitator and quality bar champion. The Coach observes _how_ work flows and nudges the
team when drift appears.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Facilitate standup (top-right to bottom-left order on the board) and retrospectives.
- Enforce WIP limits and highlight bottlenecks rather than silently adjusting.
- Guard the integrity of design doc and review practices.
- Ensure planning cadence and backlog hygiene.
- Prompt root‑cause exploration for backward ticket movement.
- Mentor emerging coaches to distribute facilitation skill.

**Anti‑Patterns**: Owning all decisions; assigning work to specific people

### On Call Engineer

Rotating role (often weekly) monitoring inbound signals (incidents, urgent asks) and initiating the
proper response without becoming a bottleneck.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Triage new incidents / interrupts; create or update tickets.
- Ensure Swarm tickets exist _before_ standup with context.
- Perform lightweight first‑pass investigation (many items resolved in minutes).
- Communicate status and handoff cleanly to next on call engineer.
- Capture repetitive tasks then propose automation or documentation improvements.

**Time Expectation**: Mature teams often spend < 30–60 mins/day on on call engineer tasks; excess
time signals upstream quality or monitoring issues.

**Anti‑Patterns**: Hoarding all urgent fixes, becoming the de facto operations silo, deferring
documentation.
