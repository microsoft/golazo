# Golazo

## Summary

Golazo is a lightweight engineering methodology for small and mid-sized teams that attacks common
delivery friction: rework hidden in code reviews, slow feedback loops, knowledge silos, multitasking
overload, and fragile ownership patterns. It constrains the amount of parallel tasks, front‑loads
shared understanding with tiny design docs, prioritizes by value, and closes the loop with explicit
customer validation. Regular retrospectives ensure that every piece of the process has a net
positive return on investment.

Golazo keeps teams fast and sane by making work small, visible, collaboratively understood early,
and finished with real validation. It trades batch size and premature isolation for flow, shared
context, and adaptability—yielding fewer surprises, faster merges, and happier engineers even when
working in different timezones.

_TODO: A ~10 min embedded video will be added here to summarize these docs_

## Who It’s For

- Teams wanting predictable throughput
- In-person, hybrid, or asynchronous teams aiming to reduce meeting load and handoff friction
  through stronger async collaboration (small shared design docs + visible flow)
- Small to medium product or platform groups (≈4–10 engineers)
- Teams looking to do more with less while reducing incident rate and code review debates
- Orgs seeking higher morale and faster new‑hire ramp

## What Makes It Different

- Collaborative design upfront: Lightweight design doc and 2 signoffs before implementation
- Work In Progress limits to maximize focus and completion rate
- Visual flow board with priority rails (Swarm / Interrupt / Planned) for instant situational
  awareness
- Small, value‑sliced tickets and Weighted Shortest Job First planning enable rapid adaptation
  mid-cycle
- Integrated review loop: smaller code reviews focused on detail, not architecture debates
- Shared ownership: Anyone can pull any Ready ticket—knowledge spreads naturally
- Lower defect rates through quality gates: Design review catches issues early, Work In Progress
  limits enable swarm response to incidents, and small batch sizes reduce integration risks
- Higher morale and faster onboarding: Autonomy to pull work, pairing for knowledge transfer,
  collaborative design, and shared ownership reduce frustration and accelerate new-hire productivity
- Living library of concise design docs builds durable, searchable team context which informs future
  decisions, reduces single‑expert risk, and powers AI assistants with high‑fidelity context
- Customer Validation as a distinct stage; Done means value observed, not just code merged
