# Golazo: Lean Team Flow

## Summary

Golazo is a lightweight engineering methodology for small and mid-sized teams that attacks common
delivery friction: rework hidden in PRs, slow feedback loops, knowledge silos, multitasking
overload, and fragile ownership patterns. It constrains WIP, front‑loads shared understanding with
tiny design docs, prioritizes by economic value (WSJF), and closes the loop with explicit customer
validation. Regular retrospectives ensure that every piece of the process has a net positive ROI.

Golazo keeps teams fast and sane by making work small, visible, collaboratively understood early,
and finished with real validation. It trades batch size and premature isolation for flow, shared
context, and adaptability—yielding fewer surprises, faster merges, and happier engineers even when
working in different timezones.

## Who It’s For

- In-person, hybrid, or asynchronous teams wanting predictable throughput
- Small to medium product or platform groups (≈4–10 engineers)
- Teams looking to do more with less while reducing incident rate and PR debates
- Orgs seeking higher morale and faster new‑hire ramp

## What Makes It Different

- "Think Together Early": Lightweight design doc + 2 signoffs before implementation
- WIP limits to maximize focus and completion rate
- Visual flow board with priority rails (Swarm / Interrupt / Planned) for instant situational
  awareness
- Small, value‑sliced tickets + WSJF planning enable rapid adaptation mid-cycle
- Integrated review loop: smaller PRs focused on detail, not architecture debates
- Shared ownership: Anyone can pull any Ready ticket—knowledge spreads naturally
- Living library of concise design docs builds durable, searchable team context which accelerates
  onboarding, informs future decisions, reduces single‑expert risk, and powers AI assistants with
  high‑fidelity context
- Customer Validation as a distinct stage; Done means value observed, not just code merged
