# Frequently Asked Questions

## Team Operation

**How big should a team be?** 6–8 engineers is a sweet spot: enough diversity for collaboration,
small enough for shared context. Larger groups can split boards and sync leads periodically.

**Can a single engineer use Golazo practices?** Yes! It's a great way to visualize work, draft mini
design docs, enforce personal WIP, and request external peer reviews for key changes.

**What if a ticket stalls?** Raise in standup immediately. If aging continues, Value Stream Map it
to identify hidden dependencies, over‑sizing, or unclear definition of done.

## Adoption and Transition

**How long is the trial?** A focused 90‑day period (see [Adoption Guide](adoption-guide.md)).
Shorter trials rarely expose the compounding benefits.

**Do we customize Golazo early?** Resist customization unless there is a real blocker. Give it a
full try first and only change with explicit rationale and rollback criteria. Consider discussing
the change with someone more experienced with Golazo. Teams changing the core process is one of the
biggest reasons for process failure.

**What if leadership pressures for more simultaneous work?** Show impact projections: increasing WIP
tends to increase cycle time. Discuss relative priority of projects. Show metrics to demonstrate
high ticket throughput, no bug backlog, and higher team morale.

## Roles and Ownership

**What happens if someone picks a ticket beyond their current expertise?** That's encouraged! Pair
early. Slower single ticket now accelerates future velocity via knowledge spread.

**How do senior engineers show growth?** Through architectural stewardship (design reviews), backlog
shaping, mentoring, quality bar leadership, and cross‑team influence recorded in design docs and
retros.

## Quality and Design Docs

**Aren't design docs overhead for tiny changes?** Keep them proportional. Even a 5‑bullet doc for a
small change catches missing tests or existing abstractions to reuse. Five or ten minutes spent
writing a design doc while the context is fresh can pay enormous dividends in the future.

**What if reviewers disagree?** Capture the options and trade‑offs succinctly in the doc; if
consensus still fails, timebox a focused huddle, then document the decision and reasoning.

**Why require two design AND two PR reviews?** Redundancy spreads knowledge, reduces blind spots,
and maintains consistency; small tickets keep review load reasonable.

## Metrics and Success

**How do we know it’s working?** Improvements in cycle time, reduced interrupt ratio, lower incident
frequency, broader Shepherd distribution, and positive pulse survey trends. Mature Golazo teams will
also fight hard to keep the Golazo process becuse they've lived the benefits both for productivity
and morale.

**What if metrics improve but morale drops?** Re‑examine WIP pressure, review load, and meeting
hygiene. Principle application may have become dogmatic; engage team in a Starfish Retro.

**Is velocity story point tracking needed?** No. Cycle time and throughput and quality metrics
provide richer insight; story points often devolve into negotiation games.

## Miscellaneous

**Can we use sprints?** You can, but Golazo does not require timeboxed iterations; continuous flow
and periodic planning typically yields smoother delivery.

**How do we manage external stakeholder asks?** Capture as backlog items, clarify acceptance
criteria, then WSJF rank. Avoid side channels creating invisible work.
