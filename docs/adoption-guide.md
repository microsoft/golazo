# Adopting Golazo

## Summary

A deliberate 90‑day, "by the book" trial lets a team experience full benefits—improved flow,
quality, and learning—before deciding what to tailor. Partial adoption early almost always
underdelivers.

## Team Size and Suitability

Ideal core team size: 6–8 engineers. Smaller teams work well; larger teams may split into two boards
with periodic sync. Research‑heavy teams or platform teams can adapt ticket definitions but should
maintain short validation cycles.

## Prerequisites

| Area                 | Requirement                                                                     | Notes                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Leadership Support   | Agreement not to override core practices mid‑trial                              | Shield from premature customization |
| Coach                | Access to experienced internal or external coach for at least the first 4 weeks | Can be borrowed from another team   |
| Tooling              | Visual board, shared design doc space, chat channels                            | Keep setup lightweight              |
| Psychological Safety | Blameless retros                                                                | Essential for honest improvement    |

## Handling Downsides and Concerns

| Concern                                | Response                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too much ceremony"                    | Ceremonies are intentionally short; measure time spent—should be a small fraction compared to regained flow.                           |
| "Hard boundary with other teams"       | Use Ready gate and clear acceptance criteria to collaborate; share design docs early with dependents.                                  |
| Career progression for senior IC scope | Seniors lead architectural alignment, backlog shaping, and mentoring—document leadership contributions in design rationale and retros. |
| "Design docs slow us down"             | Track PR churn before and after; most teams see net reduction in total time to deliver.                                                |

## Common Anti‑Patterns

- Cherry‑picking only "visible" practices like standup while skipping design docs or reviews.
- Ignoring WIP limits when pressure rises with a "just this once" mentality.
- Letting spikes grow into hidden implementation work.
- Delaying customer validation—tickets linger in Release/Done without confirmation.
- Premature customization such as adding extra columns before baseline flow is stable.

- [ ] Board created with columns, rails, WIP limits
- [ ] Communication channels live
- [ ] Design doc template accessible
- [ ] First 10 backlog items refined & prioritized
