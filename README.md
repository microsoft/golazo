# Golazo Documentation

A comprehensive documentation repository for the Golazo development methodology - a minimal team
development process that excels in hybrid, asynchronous work environments while maximizing value
delivery and team morale.

## Purpose

development methodology that enables teams to:

- Deliver value quickly through small, iterative work items
- Operate efficiently in hybrid and remote work environments
- Maintain high team morale and shared accountability
- Eliminate waste while building quality in from the start
- Foster knowledge sharing and collaborative ownership
